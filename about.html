            <p>
                Hey there! I'm Adam Faskowitz, a Lead Data Scientist at TIBCO and a proud UC Berkeley alumnus. My areas of interest include data visualization, machine learning, and effective communication within data science. I'm passionate about using my data science skills to tackle complex problems and devise meaningful solutions.

                Outside of work, I enjoy watching and playing sports, exploring art museums, and unwinding at the beach. As a child, I was fascinated by baseball cards and loved analyzing the statistics on the back. I would even create my own teams and simulate games for fun. This passion for numbers and problem-solving followed me to college, where I took my first data science course at Berkeley. I was immediately hooked by the versatile applications of data science across various fields.

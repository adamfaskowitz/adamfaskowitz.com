            Hey! My name is Adam Faskowitz and I am a Lead Data Scientist at TIBCO and a recent graduate from UC Berkeley. My interests include data visualization, machine learning, and communication within data science. My passion for data science is driven by my curiosity for trying to understand complex problems and goal of creating meaningful solutions. In my free time, I enjoy watching and playing sports, going to art museums, and relaxing at the beach. As a kid, I always loved baseball cards and analyzing the statistics on the back. I would even run simulations of games with made up teams for fun. My freshman year at Berkeley, my personal and academic interests coincided when I took my first data science course. I loved the problem-solving and how I could apply my learnings to just about anything. This site is meant to host some of the projects that I have done using those data science skills.
